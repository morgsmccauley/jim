- modal for creating new workout
- prettier
- material ui
- redux

issues:
- test runner breaks when an external module is used in the component.
  ts-node is unable to run the tests because the external module is not compiled to a compatible target. usually complains about 'import'
  possible solutions:
    - compile to js then run mocha
    - compile node_modules as well as source, can use --ignore flag for ts-node somehow
    - mock the external modules
